# GoLang C2 Framework

This project contains a simple command-and-control (C2) server and implant written in Go. It is intended for **authorized red team engagements and educational use only**. The tools provided are meant to help security professionals test their defenses in a controlled setting.

## Disclaimer
This framework must only be used in legitimate red team operations with the full knowledge and consent of the target organization. Using this code on networks or hosts without explicit permission may violate laws and regulations. The authors and contributors take no responsibility for any misuse. Always obtain written authorization before deploying these tools, and ensure you comply with all applicable laws and policies.
Unauthorized or malicious use of this framework is strictly prohibited. By using these tools you accept full responsibility for your actions and any consequences that may arise. They are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.

## Requirements
- Go 1.22 or newer
- A MySQL instance for the server

## Setup
1. Generate or supply TLS certificates inside the `certs/` directory.
2. Build the server and implant (specify output names to avoid conflicts with the directories):
   ```bash
   go build -o server_app ./server
   go build -o implant_app ./implant
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   ./server_app
   ```
4. Run the implant on the target system. It connects to `127.0.0.1:5000` by default. The binaries look for certificate and key files relative to their own location, so keep the `certs` folder next to the executables.

## Server CLI Usage
The attacker CLI supports the following commands:
- `list` &ndash; display connected implants
- `send <IP> <command>` &ndash; run a command on a specific implant
- `broadcast <command>` &ndash; run a command on all implants
- `remove <IP>` &ndash; remove an implant from the list
- `help` &ndash; show available commands
- `exit` &ndash; terminate the server

## Implant Features
- Connects to the C2 server over TLS and validates the server certificate
- Executes shell commands received from the server
- Encrypts command output using RSA OAEP and sends it back
- Builtâ€‘in commands:
  - `sleep <seconds>` &ndash; change the delay between command fetches
  - `sysinfo` &ndash; return basic host and OS information

Use these tools responsibly and only in environments where you have permission.
